The current program has three processes that each acquire a mutex, then try to acquire one more, however, all three resources are being held causing the program to hang. There are multiple ways to handle these scenarios. We can let deadlocks occur as long as we have methods for recognizing them and recovering from them. We could prevent them from happening by delaying acquisition of resources until they're ready. We could use a wait-for graph to search for cycles then implement a fixed order for acquiring resources.
